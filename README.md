# ESP8266 sensor node

ESP8266 firmware that talks to one or two BME280 sensors via IÂ²C and exposes
their data as Prometheus metrics. Uses a coroutine-based HTTP server to
support concurrent connections (mostly to avoid hanging the whole server
if a single client hangs).

Various third-party code is vendored under libs/ and licensed under various
licenses (see the file headers). The code under src/ is licensed under the
MIT license.
